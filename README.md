# AgroScan-Citrus_Leaf_Disease_Detection
To prevent and recognise diseases early regarding leafs of citrus plants based on image classification of leaf images and built a CNN deep learning models to identify early leaf diseases and to make better livelihoods of indian farmers.

🍊 Citrus Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning
ResNet101 • DenseNet201 • AlexNet (Comparative Study)

This project builds a deep learning-based early disease detection system for citrus leaves using ResNet101, DenseNet201, and AlexNet.
The goal is to support farmers and agricultural experts through faster and more accurate diagnosis of citrus leaf diseases.

🚀 Features
